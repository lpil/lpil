<p>
  Our top priority when giving an estimate is to avoid future disagreement over
  the invoice. We therefore quote complete project costs, including unlimited
  corrections over the specified proof stages and no extra charges for fast
  turnarounds.
</p>
<p>
  This can make our estimates appear more expensive than others but our final
  invoices are usually lower. Why do we do it?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Because we want to build long term relationships with our clients and
    invoice disagreements spoil relationships and undermine trust
  </li>
  <li>
    Because it saves us money – we don’t need to employ an army of costing
    clerks
  </li>
  <li>
    Because we like the culture throughout our company to be open and
    transparent
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So when comparing estimates from financial printers please read the small
  print. Perivan’s won’t take long.
