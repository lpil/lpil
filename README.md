Frontend Boilerplate
====================

A starting point for simple frontend apps.

This template includes webpack for compiling all your application's Javascript
and CSS files into one Javascript file that can be downloaded by the user.

To use this template clone the repo, delete the `.git` directory that is
inside the repo, git init your own project, and then start hacking. :)

## Usage

```sh
# Run the development server
#   This will allow you to go to localhost:8080 and view your project there
#   Each time you hit refresh it will recompile your project so you can see
#   the latest changes.
npm start

# Compile the project into one JS file, one CSS file, and one HTML file
#   This will run webpack so that the final application is bundled into files
#   that can be put on a web server and served to an end user.
npm run build
```

## Things to add

- [ ] Testing with mocha and chai
- [ ] JS and CSS minification
- [ ] SCSS compilation if desired
