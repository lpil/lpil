    Over two years of working with Elixir I (almost accidentally) went from
    knowing nothing about compilers to having my own programming language
    running on the BEAM. In this talk I detail this journey, and share the rich
    range of tools that Elixir and Erlang offer us when parsing and compiling
    code.

  notes: |
    Automatic test runners are my go-to tool for creating a fast feedback loop
    when writing software. Alas, Elixir didn't have one back in the days of
    version 1.0, so I had to make my own.

    In this talk I give a little code tour of the `mix test.watch` test runner
    I made, and show some of the things I learnt about the compiler in doing
    so. This was my first public programming talk, and it inspired the
    excellent `--stale` option of `mix test`, Elixir's regular test runner.
