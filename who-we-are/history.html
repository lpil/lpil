<p>
  Perivan has a long tradition in financial printing, and as the producer of
  the largest number of annual reports in the UK, has developed relationships
  with many company secretaries.
</p>
<p>
  The original idea and potential for Virtualboardroom was first recognised on
  a client visit to Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, in March 2007.  The fund
  administration community needed a facility to help streamline the compilation
  and dissemination of board packs created on behalf of their fund clients for
  whom they organised and managed quarterly board meetings.
</p>
<p>
  With our history and expertise in document creation and distribution, we saw
  this as an exciting new opportunity and invited a number of company
  secretarial clients to help us with our research and provide us with an
  insight into what they would want from such a product, this included a very
  clear message: 
<h2>
  Keep it simple.
</h2>
<p>
  After a period of development encompassing extensive and exhaustive
  trialling, Virtualboardroom was launched in June 2008. 
</p>
<p>
  The benefits of the product to any business with a corporate governance
  structure and holding regular board meetings were soon realised.  Interest
  was shown from organisations as far afield as the US, South Africa and
  Australia in addition to numerous domestic sectors including PLC’s, housing
  associations, NHS Trusts and charities.
</p>
<p>
  Today, Virtualboardroom is the board portal of choice for over 1400 boards
  and committees around the world and keeping it simple is still one of our
  main priorities.
