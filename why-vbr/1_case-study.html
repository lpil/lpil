  This case study refers to one of our clients who implemented
  Virtualboardroom.
</p>
<h2>
  The Challenge
</h2>
<p>
  It took the company secretary two days per month to put together the printed
  board packs for each of the ten board members. The process was costing the
  company £4,310 per year. They were determined to find the most cost effective
  solution whilst increasing their efficiency and improving their environmental
  impact.
</p>
<h2>
  The Solution
</h2>
<p>
  The company secretary implemented Virtualboardroom in order to make it easier
  for board members to collaborate over documentation, reduce the time it takes
  to produce board packs, and facilitate digital distribution of the packs to
  board members.
</p>
<h2>
  Choosing iPads
</h2>
<p>
  The company bought each of the board members a standard 3G/16GB iPad after
  assessing the relative savings of using iPads with Virtualboardroom, compared
  to printing hard copies. Investing in Virtualboardroom and an iPad for each
  board member has reduced overall board pack production expenditure by 44%.
</p>
<h2>
  The Figures
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1,800 employees</li>
  <li>10 board members</li>
  <li>250 pages on average</li>
  <li>12 meetings a year</li>
  <li>5 working weeks saved per year</li>
  <li>44% cost reduction</li>
  <li>12 iPads purchased</li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Savings thanks to Virtualboardroom
</h2>
<p>
  Virtualboardroom has saved the company secretary nearly five working weeks
  per year, allowing them time to get on with more business critical tasks.
  Board members also report feeling more up to date, having access to their
  documents from wherever they are in the world.
