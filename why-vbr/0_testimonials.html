  <p>
    A fundamental part of our service offering is the accuracy, presentation
    and timely distribution of a large volume of board meeting material to
    clients and directors in a number of jurisdictions..
  </p>
  <p>
    The rollout of Virtualboardroom around Aztec Group's client boards has
    enabled us to slash our input costs, whilst providing a hugely enhanced
    boardpack offering to our clients and non-executive directors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simplicity, efficiency and robust nature of the Virtualboardroom
    product has turned an otherwise dull and labour intensive administration
    area into a slick, automated and highly configurable process. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The people at Virtualboardroom are constantly looking at ways to enhance
    the system and are more than willing to listen to their clients'
    experiences as the foundation for new, innovative upgrades.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is potential game-changing technology for back-office service
    providers!

    The Boardpack  software is a fantastic tool for saving time and improving
    working practices. It takes away all the hassle of printing and collating
    board papers and the finished product looks very professional. It’s well
    worth getting and the team at Virtualboardroom are friendly and helpful if
    you ever happen to run into any problems.

  <p>
    Having spent 2½ years putting board packs together ‘the old fashioned way’,
    to be given something as effective, quick to use, efficient and without
    leaving the comfort of my office chair is an absolute god-send! 
  </p>
  <p>
    As soon as I started trialling, I realised it was as easy as anything.  The
    user guide was very helpful, and should you get stuck, the support team at
    Virtualboardroom is only too happy to help.  
  </p>
  <p>
    In a nutshell – the Boardpack software is very user friendly, time and cost
    effective, clear and concise, and the presentation of the finished product
    is better than anything I could have created myself.  It used to take me
    the best part of 2 days to complete our board packs.  Now, from the time of
    uploading the reports, to the time I have the printed copies, it’s half a
    day – 75% time reduction!
