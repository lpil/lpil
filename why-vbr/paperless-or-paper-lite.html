title: Paperless or Paper-lite?

<p>
  Going “paperless” is a high aspiration – one which Virtualboardroom can help
  you achieve. But perhaps moving towards it through a “paper-lite” phase is a
  more realistic target.
</p>
<p>
  Not everyone feels comfortable reading information electronically and some of
  our clients tell us many users still prefer paper, particularly when
  attending the actual board meeting.
</p>
<p>
  That’s why the Boardpack tool in Virtualboardroom generates, and allows you
  to publish, both a print version and an e-version of your documents. This
  lets you reduce paper usage where individual board members elect to view
  electronically while still giving them choice in their preferred viewing
  method.

<p>
  You can still improve your “green” credentials while continuing to use paper
  and this link to the Confederation of Paper Industries website provides a lot
  of useful information on the subject:
